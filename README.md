This repository demonstrates a common issue with the `useParams` hook in React Router v6 when used within deeply nested routes.  The problem occurs when a parent route doesn't match, causing the nested component's `useParams` hook to return undefined.  The solution involves carefully structuring the routes and potentially using a fallback component to manage scenarios where parent routes are not matched.
